# Writeup: Track 3D-Objects Over Time
- Find and display 10 examples of vehicles with varying degrees of visibility in the point-cloud
- Identify vehicle features that appear as a stable feature on most vehicles (e.g. rear-bumper, tail-lights) and describe them briefly. Also, use the range image viewer from the last example to underpin your findings using the lidar intensity channel.
